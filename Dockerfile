# This file can be run standalone and should work from any state of the working
# directory. The command `yarn docker:build` will build a tagged image.
# Then the command `yarn docker:run` will conveniently execute the image. It's
# possible to pass extra arguments to this command to execute another program
# instead of the default. See docs-developer/docker.md for more information.

# Setup a container and build the project in it
# We set up a node 18 running in latest Debian stable called bookworm, in the
# "slim" flavor because we don't need the big version.
# NOTE: if you update the image here, don't forget to update it below as well.
